# TeamHODL HOLD Tokens
[![Built with Love](http://i.imgur.com/cB5v58b.png)](https://teamhodl.com)

This repo contains Solidity smart contract code to issue simple, standards-compliant tokens on Ethereum.   

The default is [StandardToken.sol](https://github.com/ConsenSys/Tokens/blob/master/contracts/StandardToken.sol) which implements the core ERC20 standard functionality [#20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20).  



## Mission

One thing the crypto-sphere is sorely missing however is a soundtrack. Although there are various
songs of different levels of quality, there has been no concerted effort to create a consolidated
body of work. This surprising void has led us to create the first Crypto Rap album, our self-titled
6-track EP, teamHODL. The name is derived from the philosophy-turned-meme of “Holding On for
Dear Life”, which has been applied to crypto investments but also to the promising yet turbulent
adoption of blockchain technology and life itself. All of our experiences and lessons in the space
have been channeled into tracks that are as catchy as they are lyrically poignant.


We are immensely proud of this EP, so much so that we realized we couldn’t just release it as an
ordinary album. We decided that to best embody the concept of HODL, we would create the
solution to crowdfunding we want; essentially Kickstarter meets an ICO wherein the tokens are
tied to the value and sales of the album. 



## Testing

Solidity, Truffle tests have to still be written.

All tests are currently passing on [Remix](http://ethereum.github.io/browser-solidity/#version=soljson-latest.js).
